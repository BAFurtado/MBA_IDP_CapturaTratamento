### DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself
1. Encapsulation

*Wrapping a piece of code up in a function is called encapsulation. One of the benefits of encapsulation is that 
it attaches a name to the code, which serves as a kind of documentation. Another advantage is that if you re-use 
the code, it is more concise to call a function twice than to copy and paste the body!*

2. Generalization

*Adding a parameter to a function is called generalization because it makes the function more general*
